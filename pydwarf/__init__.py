'''

The pydwarf package acts as a layer of abstraction over the raws package, providing functionality for mod management and application.

pydwarf.log: A shared logging object.
pydwarf.version: Utilities pertinent to handling Dwarf Fortress versions.
pydwarf.response: PyDwarf expects plugins to return pydwarf.response objects.
pydwarf.urist: A combined decorator and global repository for PyDwarf plugins.
pydwarf.session: Ideally for use by a mod manager, abstracts the handling and execution of PyDwarf plugins.
pydwarf.config: Provides an object to simplify config loading and application.
