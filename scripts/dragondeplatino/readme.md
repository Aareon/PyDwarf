# GemSet v1.32

Colorful, sharp, and crystal-clear.

Created by DragonDePlatino. (http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=150753.msg6230901#msg6230901)  
Rewritten for PyDwarf by Sophie Kirschner. (http://www.pineapplemachine.com)

## Introduction

The first complete 24x24 graphics set for Dwarf Fortress, GemSet provides the aesthetics of ASCII and convenience of graphics.

Drawn natively in a 24x24 resolution for 1080p and 4K displays, GemSet is much more crisp than its 16x16 contemporaries. The entire graphics set uses a bright 32-color palette, so everything will be crystal-clear on even the highest-resolution displays. All profession graphics are color-coded according to their ASCII counterparts and black has been kept as the dominant color of the graphics set. If you want graphics but don't want to sacrifice the aesthetics of ASCII, this is the graphics set for you.

Included in the mod are these:
* 24x24 and 48x48 versions of all creatures.
* TWBT overrides for all items and tiles. Buildings coming soon.
* A hand-drawn curses_24 and curses_48 tileset.
* A new set of raws and several BAMM! scripts for installation.
* An OnLoad.init for custom multilayer settings.

## Requirements

GemSet requires that both [DFHack](https://github.com/DFHack/dfhack/releases) and [TWBT](https://github.com/mifki/df-twbt/releases) be installed.

## PyDwarf Components

### dragondeplatino.gemset.full

Performs a full installation, and this is probably what you want to run. By default the 24x24 graphics set is installed, but this behavior can be changed by running `{"name": "dragondeplatino.gemset.full", "args": {"variety": "4x848"}}`. In this case, the 48x48 set would be installed instead. The options accepted for this argument are `24x24` and `48x48`.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.art

Writes miscelleneous image files to `data/art/`. Accepts a `variety` argument same as `dragondeplatino.gemset.full`, which also defaults to the 24x24 graphics set.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.font

Puts the appropriate curses and map files in their appropriate places, and modifies settings in `data/init/init.txt` such that the new graphics will be loaded. Also accepts a `variety` argument.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.graphics

Writes a number of image and raws files to `raw/graphics/`. Accepts the same `variety` argument.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.hack

Adds `multilevel` commands to DFHack's `raw/onLoad.init`. Doesn't need a `variety` argument.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.objects

In the raws, sets the tiles and colors for creatures, inorganics, and some plants. Also doesn't take a `variety` argument.

### dragondeplatino.gemset.twbt

Handles TWBT files: An `overrides.txt` file is placed in `data/init/` and the pertinent image files are placed in `data/art/`. Accepts a `variety` argument.

## Help Wanted

I am unable to view GemSet on my monitor without it being squished to 1600x900. [Share your 1080p and 4K screenshots, please!](http://www.bay12forums.com/smf/index.php?topic=150753.msg6230901#msg6230901)

I may be missing some overrides. Notify me if you see any strange or missing graphics.

## Donations

When I first conceived this project, I wanted to make Dwarf Fortress more accessible and bring more people into the community. It's my way of thanking the developers for everything they've done. So if you're reading this, please consider supporting Dwarf Fortress by donating to Bay 12 Games. Dwarf Fortress wouldn't have been possible without the incredible dedication of Toady One and ThreeToe.
