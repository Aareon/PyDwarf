# List of mods

## deepappear

Useful for changing the tile and color of single creatures. The default arguments change the appearance of deer from a brown D to a yellow D.

## diff

Can be used to merge and apply changes made to modified raws. Attempting to apply changes made to raws belonging to differing Dwarf Fortress versions in this way may lead to errors. When the script is run it will notify the user of any conflicts so that they can be resolved manually.

## flybears

A simple example script which adds a `[FLIER]` tag to all female vanilla bears.

## noexotic

Replaces all `[PET_EXOTIC]` and `[MOUNT_EXOTIC]` tokens with `[PET]` and `[MOUNT]` tokens, respectively. This will make it possible to train many animals that otherwise could not be.

## nograzers

Removes all `[GRAZER]` and `[STANDARD_GRAZER]` tokens. With this script applied animals will no longer need to be pastured where vegetation is present.

## stoneclarity

Can be used to set the appearance of stones, ores, and gems based on customizable rules. Can be useful to make it easier to recognize the purpose of some unmined tile at a glance.

## subplants

Makes all subterranean plants grow year-round, regardless of season.
