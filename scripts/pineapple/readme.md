# List of mods

Mods created for PyDwarf by Sophie Kirschner. (http://www.pineapplemachine.com)

## bauxitetoaluminum

Adds a reaction to get aluminum bars from bauxite and cryolite and reduces the value of aluminum to account for the increased availability.

## deerappear

Useful for changing the tile and color of single creatures. The default arguments change the appearance of deer from a brown D to a yellow d.

## diff

Can be used to merge and apply changes made to modified raws. Attempting to apply changes made to raws belonging to differing Dwarf Fortress versions in this way may lead to errors. When the script is run it will notify the user of any conflicts so that they can be resolved manually.

## discipline

Adds discipline as a natural skill to creatures that shouldn't be running away so easily. Creatures given bonuses include civilized creatures, trainable creatures, evil creatures, megabeasts, and more.

## flybears

A simple example script which adds a `[FLIER]` tag to all female vanilla bears.

## greensteel

Adds a new alloy of steel and adamantine, green steel, which is superior to steel but weaker than adamantine. It can also be smelted as an alloy of steel and a new adamant ore, which is very similar to adamantine but occurs normally (though rarely) in clusters and veins and cannot be used to create items such as weapons and armor.

## metalitems

Allows forging items of types using metals normally disallowed by Dwarf Fortress. For example, with the default arguments, this script will allow the forging of golden weapons and armor. (How useful that equipment would actually be is questionable, but as we all know !!fun!! doesn't ask those sorts of questions.)

## noexotic

Replaces all `[PET_EXOTIC]` and `[MOUNT_EXOTIC]` tokens with `[PET]` and `[MOUNT]` tokens, respectively. This will make it possible to train many animals that otherwise could not be.

## nograzers

Removes all `[GRAZER]` and `[STANDARD_GRAZER]` tokens. With this script applied animals will no longer need to be pastured where vegetation is present.

## stoneclarity

Can be used to set the appearance of stones, ores, and gems based on customizable rules. Can be useful to make it easier to recognize the purpose of some unmined tile at a glance.

## subplants

Makes all subterranean plants grow year-round, regardless of season.
