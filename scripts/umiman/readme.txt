A collection of descriptive mods which aim to add more spice to Dwarf Fortress's text and dialogue.

* Prefstring minimod: Adds more flavour text to a dwarf's profile. Dwarves now have at least 5 proper reasons to like something instead of the current basic text.
* Engraving minimod: Adds over 200 new engravings so you won't have to constantly see "This is an engraving of a square"

Plant prefstrings still need to be added.

Many of these are collected from the community.  The philosophy behind each included addition is as follows:

1. The mod should be universal. I.E: if someone were to use this mod in conjunction with others, they should not only be compatible, but not break the illusion.
2. The mod should be in the vein of the Dwarf Fortress universe and not break the illusion that you are in it (except in rare cases of comedy).
3. The mod should be as descriptively neutral as possible and so work for goblins just as it would for elves or dwarves so as to not break the illusion.
4. Try to put things Toady would have put in if he had the time.
5. Only focus on what the mod is supposed to do. Hence, my small things mod will not do ANYTHING except add descriptive words and text.
6. Maintain the illusion.]
