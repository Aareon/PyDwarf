----------

Description:
Has this been done before? While I think it's impossible to change any of the inbuilt engraving stuff like, "this is a picture of a dwarf and a tentacle demon. The dwarf is embracing the tentacle demon", it is possible to edit and add to more basic ones such as "this is a picture of a crescent moon".

Basically, I added maybe 100 or so new engravings you can potentially see on your floors, walls, studded armour, images, and the like. Keep in mind maybe one or two metagame just a tad but it's funny! I swear!

Hope you like it, if you have any suggestions or comments, email me at umiman_at_gmail.com.

My philosophy:
- The mod should be universal. I.E: if someone were to use this mod in conjuction of others, they should not only be compatible, but not break the illusion.
- The mod should be in the vein of the Dwarf Fortress universe and not break the illusion that you are in it (except in rare cases of comedy).
- The mod should be as descriptively neutral as possible and so work for goblins just as it would for elves or dwarves so as to not break the illusion.
- Try to put things Toady would have put in if he had the time.
- Only focus on what the mod is supposed to do. Hence, my engraving mod will not do anything except add engravings.
- Maintain the illusion.
