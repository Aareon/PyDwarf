A collection of descriptive mods which aim to add more spice to Dwarf Fortress's text and dialogue.

## engraving

Has this been done before? While I think it's impossible to change any of the inbuilt engraving stuff like, "this is a picture of a dwarf and a tentacle demon. The dwarf is embracing the tentacle demon", it is possible to edit and add to more basic ones such as "this is a picture of a crescent moon". Basically, I added maybe 200 or so new engravings you can potentially see on your floors, walls, studded armour, images, and the like. Keep in mind maybe one or two metagame just a tad but it's funny! I swear!

## prefstring

This mod simply just adds to the number of prefstrings for everything in the game to a minimum of five each. Prefstrings are the stuff that tell your dwarves what to like about a creature. For example, "He likes large roaches for their ability to disgust". With this mod, you'll see more fleshed out descriptions of the things your dwarves like, as well as more varied ones. With five each, it's pretty rare to see the same two twice. Hopefully I don't have any repeating prefstrings

Plant prefstrings still need to be added.

Many of these are collected from the community.  The philosophy behind each included addition is as follows:

* The mod should be universal. I.E: if someone were to use this mod in conjunction with others, they should not only be compatible, but not break the illusion.
* The mod should be in the vein of the Dwarf Fortress universe and not break the illusion that you are in it (except in rare cases of comedy).
* The mod should be as descriptively neutral as possible and so work for goblins just as it would for elves or dwarves so as to not break the illusion.
* Try to put things Toady would have put in if he had the time.
* Only focus on what the mod is supposed to do. Hence, my small things mod will not do ANYTHING except add descriptive words and text.
* Maintain the illusion.]

## speech

Awhile back I asked the community to contribute to fill out the threat.txt which is used in adventurer when someone threatens you. I.E: in vanilla, when you face a megabeast or someone who has killed a named creature, they will talk about who they killed and then say, "prepare to die!!!". That's all they said. Boring. This compilation has some of the best threats (around 150 and counting) compiled from that thread and should make killing things too proud of their own achievements a lot more fun.

### nofamily

Adds dialog options to no_family.txt, the vanilla version of which contains only "I have no family to speak of".

### threats

Adds dialog options to threats.txt, the vanilla version of which contains only "Prepare to die!".
