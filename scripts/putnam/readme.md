## Materials Plus

Adds a bunch of materials to the game.

New reactions in materials plus are:

1. Steel making using manganese. 3 bars of iron and 1 bar of manganese will get you 4 bars of steel; one iron ore and one manganese ore will get you 4 steel, 3 manganese and 1 iron.
2. High-speed steel making. A slightly stronger variation of steel. Takes 6 bars of steel and one bar each of vanadium, chromium, tungsten and molybdenum and gets you 10 bars of high-speed steel.
3. Beryllium refining. Makes a pair of tokens that automatically goes through the process as available. The process requires:
    1. one [beryllium-bearing boulder OR 4 beryllium-bearing gems](https://github.com/Putnam3145/Fantastic-Mini-Mods/wiki/Materials-plus-Reaction-info)
    2. two fluorite gems
    3. a bucket of sulfuric acid, which itself requires
        1. a boulder of brimstone
        2. any item that contains vanadium (will be preserved)
        3. a bucket
    4. and a boulder of rock salt. This will get you 4 bars of beryllium. Beryllium is very light and stronger than iron, so it should be worth it.
4. The Kroll Process to refine zirconium or titanium. Makes a pair of tokens that automatically goes through the process as available. The process requires:
    1. one [titanium/zirconium-bearing boulder OR 4 titanium/zirconium-bearing gems](https://github.com/Putnam3145/Fantastic-Mini-Mods/wiki/Materials-plus-Reaction-info)
    2. a bar of coke
    3. two bars of a reducer metal (magnesium only for now), which itself requires:
        1. A [magnesium-bearing boulder](https://github.com/Putnam3145/Fantastic-Mini-Mods/wiki/Materials-plus-Reaction-info)
        2. A [silicon-bearing boulder](https://github.com/Putnam3145/Fantastic-Mini-Mods/wiki/Materials-plus-Reaction-info)
    4. This will all get you 4 bars of zirconium/titanium and give you back one bar of the reducer metal.

## Microreduce

Reactions included to reduce micromanagement in microreduce are:

* Steel making from ore; take 4 bars of coal and a boulder of iron ore to make 4 bars of steel.
* Soap macro; automatically makes the lye required to make soap and makes soap as soon as materials are available.
* Full set of clothes; makes a shirt, pants and pair of shoes from 4 cloth items, without needing any micromanagement to make all that individually.
