Armoury Pack v1.8 ported to PyDwarf by Sophie Kirschner. (http://www.pineapplemachine.com)

A couple of years ago I became rather obsessed with understanding the Dwarf Fortress combat system. I was often annoyed by how armour didn't have as much of an impact in battle as it should. Swords and axes were prone to severing limbs straight through and spears easily pierced the entirety of legs, even when made of the same material as the armour they were seemingly ignoring. I was further bothered by ranged being the end-all of combat more often than not.

This led me to many a night of searches and inspections of raws from several different mods, trying to figure out how they attempted to solved this perennial problem of mine. I ultimately stumbled across Lucelle's mod. After playing around with Lucelle's mod, I was inspired to try and fix the problem myself.

This small project is the result of almost 2 years of tweaking and too many hours spent testing in the Arena. I think it's finally come to a point where it is as balanced and sensical as it's going to be with only myself to scrutinise (One of my primary goals was to have weapons behave as they would in real life, but this is Dwarf Fortress and there will be anomalies). Of course, my idea of balance is only my own, and this is what has brought me to release this project to the public. I invite you to either help me improve this mod with critique and suggestions or simply enjoy it any other way you see fit.

v1.8 Changelog:
- Fixed some typos.
- Some weapons with only one attack option no longer specify with which part of the weapon the attack is executed.
- Added [CHAIN_METAL_TEXT] to some items of armour that were lacking it.
- Renamed civilian "chausses" to "hose" for better distinction between the cloth and armour variants.
- Renamed and tweaked both shoe-type chausses and pants-type chausses to fit in the same manner as greaves.
