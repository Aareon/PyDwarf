v1.0.2: Magma Forge

Fixed the vagueness of most exceptions in the raws and pydwarf packages, most of them should now be reasonably forthcoming about what went wrong and why.
Fixed bug in raws.token.add which was arising from a dumb typo and really should have been caught long before.
Renamed raws.dir.addfile to raws.dir.add and raws.dir.setfile to raws.dir.set.
Renamed raws.file to raws.rawfile to make things less confusing in light of some other additions.
Renamed stal.armourypack to stal.armoury because why not.
Removed pineapple.utils.addreaction, which has been superseded by the newer and shinier pineapple.utils.addobject.
Added a great deal of functionality to the raws.dir object, which is now capable of tracking an entire DF directory as opposed to just its raw/objects subdirectory.
Added three new file classes: raws.basefile, raws.reffile, and raws.binfile.
Added more documentation and tutorials, big surprise. (Also added and neglected to document a bunch of new functionality while I was at it, he he he.)
Added a number of handy new operator overloads and fiddled a few existing ones while I was at it.
Added methods like raws.queryable.removefirst, raws.queryable.removeall, and quite a few more.
Added script pkdawson.vegan, a port of df-vegan.
Added scripts underneath omniclasm.decay, a port of State of Decay.
Added scripts umiman.smallthings.threats and umiman.smallthings.nofamily, ports of parts of smallthings that PyDwarf couldn't support until now.
Added scripts pineapple.easypatch, pineapple.utils.addobject, pineapple.utils.addobjects, pineapple.utils.permitobject, pineapple.utils.permitobjects, and pineapple.utils.addhack.
Added raws.objects module which helps with knowing some things about how raws files are supposed to be structured.
Added a very nifty raws.tokenlist.each method which did great wonders for terseness of some mods.
Improved general flow and structure of manager code against pydwarf.session code, moved things around and generally tidied up.
Improved the __getitem__ method for raws.queryable objects so that now it can handle ellipses and slices and some other stuff too.
Improved the way token arguments are internally handled, and made a few changes to pertinent token methods.
Improved pineapple.utils.addentity and made a pretty big change to how it accepts arguments in the process.
Improved raws.queryable.getobj and raws.queryable.allobj methods, now they can do even more stuff than before.
Improved the raws.tokenfilter constructor, which is now decent enough to handle passing a single tuple/whatever to exact_arg, re_arg, or arg_in rather than an iterable of them.
Improved stal.armoury, putnam.materialsplus, putnam.microreduce, shukaro.higherlearning, and shukaro.creationforge by rewriting each of them entirely.
Tweaked almost every script in some way, really, mostly in the interest of utilizing newer and more awesome functionality.
